# PSP2i address map (for the VR work)

Guest addresses in NPJH50332's EBOOT.BIN, as the recompiled code sees them. Each
entry says where it came from and how sure it is. Add to this as the VR probe
(F8, `port/vr/vr_probe.h`) and the memory watches find more.

Status: **known** = used by working code; **seen** = observed, not yet relied
on; **todo** = needed for a VR phase, not found yet.

## Known (used by the port today)

| Address | What | Source |

| `0x08B81890` | setFrameRate | `host/framerate.c` |
| `0x08B81830` | Timing fill | `host/framerate.c` (`adapt`) |
| `0x08EDA54C` | Timing state: +0x08 fps (float), +0x0C fps (int), +0x10/+0x14 vblanks per frame, +0x18 30/fps, +0x1C dt | `host/framerate.c` |
| `0x08EDA560` | 1/60 s tick counter | `host/framerate.c` (`pace_ticks`) |
| `0x08EDA698` | Frame-end vcount | `host/framerate.c` |
| `0x08EE2138` | fps object pointer | `host/framerate.c` |
| `0x08A3DE1C` | "Is this the local player?" `$a0` = player object | `host/gamelog.c` (`hook_is_local`) |
| player +0x00 | vtable | `host/gamelog.c` |
| player +0x28 | player id (1 the other human; NPCs 2, 3) | `host/gamelog.c` |
| player +0x40 | status link | `host/gamelog.c` |
| player +0x6A8 | HP | `host/gamelog.c` |
| `0x08ED8CEC` | Item owner | `host/gamelog.c` |
| `0x08ED59E8`, `0x08ED5A28` | Session objects | `host/gamelog.c` |

## Needed for VR (todo)

| What | Phase | How to find it |
|---|---|---|
| Camera object: eye, target, up, FOV, near/far | P2 | F8 report: "camera position" and "view matrix" RAM hits; confirm with `--watch` on them |
| Code that builds the view matrix (to replace the camera, not just the matrix) | P2 | `PSP2I_GE_MATRIX_FLIP=N` (ge.c) shows where the view upload comes from; then the writer of the hits above |
| Frustum / LOD culling (objects pop at the headset's wider FOV) | P2 | Objects vanishing at the screen edges; the cull test reads the camera FOV or planes |
| Bloom / blur passes (signature to skip or redo per eye) | P2 | F12 dump: through-mode full-screen draws sampling a render target |
| Local player position and yaw | P4 | F8 report: the nearest skinned model's "world translation" hits; compare two reports a few steps apart |
| Player skeleton: bone indices for head, neck, spine, hands, feet | P4 / P6 | Skinned draws of the local player: bone palette per batch; hide one bone's triangles at a time |
| Weapon attach (hand) bones and weapon model draws | P5 | Draws that follow the hand bone; the item / equipment code |
| Lock-on target | P4 | Write watch on what changes when L locks on |
| Aim direction (guns, techniques) | P5 | Free-aim mode: values that follow the right stick while aiming |
| Just Attack window | P5 | The attack-combo state: what the game checks to grant a Just Attack |
| Cutscene / camera-cut state | P2 | A flag or camera mode that changes on cuts and in event scenes |

## Workflow

1. Run a development build (not `PSP2I_PROD`) and go into the field.
2. Press **F8**. `logs/vr_probe.txt` gets the scene camera, the RAM hits for
   its position and view matrix, and the skinned models nearest the line of
   sight with the RAM hits for their positions.
3. Move or turn and press F8 again. Addresses whose values followed are the real
   ones; the others were copies or coincidences.
4. Confirm with `--watch ADDR` (backtraces of writers in the logs) or
   `--watch-from-flip ADDR FLIP`.
5. Record the result here, with its source.

`PSP2I_VR_PROBE_EVERY=N` prints the scene camera every N frames to the console.
